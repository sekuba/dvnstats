# Indexer Improvements - 2025-10-31

## 1. Added `libraryStatus` Field

**Files**: `schema.graphql`, `src/EventHandlers.ts`

Added a new `libraryStatus` field to both `OAppSecurityConfig` and `PacketDelivered` entities with three possible states:

- `"tracked"` - Using the tracked ReceiveUln302 library (ULN config available and tracked)
- `"unsupported"` - Using a different/non-tracked library (ULN config unavailable)
- `"none"` - No library configured yet (neither default nor override set)

This replaces the ambiguous binary `isConfigTracked` field, which couldn't distinguish between "not configured" and "using unsupported library".

### Query Examples:

```graphql
# Find OApps using unsupported libraries
query {
  oAppSecurityConfigs(where: { libraryStatus: "unsupported" }) {
    oapp
    eid
    effectiveReceiveLibrary
  }
}

# Find OApps not yet configured
query {
  oAppSecurityConfigs(where: { libraryStatus: "none" }) {
    oapp
    eid
  }
}
```

## 2. Enhanced Peer Validation Logic

**File**: `src/EventHandlers.ts:1301-1348`

Improved `PacketDelivered` handler to distinguish three peer configuration states:

### Case 1: No Peer Ever Set
```typescript
existingPeer === undefined
```
→ Auto-creates `OAppPeer` from `PacketDelivered` (sets `fromPacketDelivered: true`)

### Case 2: Peer Explicitly Blocked (Zero Address)
```typescript
existingPeer.peer === "0x0000...0000" && fromPacketDelivered === false
```
→ **Warns**: "route explicitly blocked but packet delivered"
This indicates a potential security issue - the OApp explicitly set peer to zero address to block a route, but packets are still being delivered.

### Case 3: Peer Mismatch
```typescript
existingPeer.peer !== sender && fromPacketDelivered === false
```
→ **Warns**: "sender does not match configured peer"
The packet sender doesn't match the explicitly configured peer.

### Case 4: Valid Configuration
```typescript
existingPeer.peer === sender && fromPacketDelivered === false
```
→ No warning, normal operation

## 3. Default Fallback Documentation

**File**: `src/EventHandlers.ts:396-410, 647-657`

Added comprehensive documentation explaining how default library and config fallback works:

- Defaults set **before** an OApp exists are correctly applied when the OApp's config is later computed
- `computeAndPersistEffectiveConfig` always fetches fresh state from the database
- Default library/config changes trigger recomputation via `recomputeSecurityConfigsForScope`
- Fallback chain: override → default → undefined

This ensures that the indexer correctly handles the typical deployment order:
1. LayerZero deploys EndpointV2 + ReceiveUln302
2. Defaults are set for all endpoints
3. OApps deploy later and inherit defaults
4. OApps can override defaults per-route

## 4. Recomputation Performance Note

**File**: `src/EventHandlers.ts:755-789`

Simplified and documented the `recomputeSecurityConfigsForScope` function:

- Removed redundant outer try-catch block
- Added clear NOTE about in-memory filtering limitation
- Kept per-config error handling to continue processing on failures

Current implementation loads all `OAppSecurityConfig` entities for a chain and filters by `eid` in memory. This is acceptable for now but documented for future optimization if needed at scale (100s-1000s of OApps).

## 5. Code Cleanup

- Removed unnecessary try-catch blocks where not needed
- Kept only meaningful error handling (PacketDelivered handler + per-config recomputation)
- Added clear comments explaining sentinel values and fallback logic

## 6. Fixed Zero Address Library Handling

**File**: `src/EventHandlers.ts:430-447`

**Issue**: When an OApp set library override to `0x0` (meaning "use default") AND the default was also `0x0` or missing, the code incorrectly set `effectiveReceiveLibrary = "0x0..."`, resulting in `libraryStatus = "unsupported"`.

**Fix**: Removed the problematic branch. Now correctly sets `effectiveReceiveLibrary = undefined` → `libraryStatus = "none"` (route unconfigured).

### Zero Address Semantics (LayerZero V2):

| Context | Zero Address Means | Behavior |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Library override | "Unset override, use default" | Fall back to default library |
| Library default | "No default configured" | Route blocked/unconfigured |
| Peer | "No peer configured" | Route explicitly blocked |
| DVN | **Invalid** (should never happen) | Filtered out + warned |

**Key insight**: Zero addresses are never valid libraries or DVNs. Only peers use zero address for explicit blocking.

---

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Schema Change**: Added required `libraryStatus: String!` field

⚠️ **Zero Address Handling**: Routes with zero library (override=0x0, default=0x0) now correctly show `libraryStatus: "none"` instead of `"unsupported"`

**Migration**: Requires full resync from scratch (as discussed, backwards compatibility not needed)

## Testing Notes

After resync, verify:

1. **Library Status Distribution**:
   ```graphql
   query {
     tracked: oAppSecurityConfigs(where: { libraryStatus: "tracked" }) { id }
     unsupported: oAppSecurityConfigs(where: { libraryStatus: "unsupported" }) { id }
     none: oAppSecurityConfigs(where: { libraryStatus: "none" }) { id }
   }
   ```

2. **Peer Warnings**: Check logs for the new warning messages:
   - "route explicitly blocked but packet delivered"
   - "sender does not match configured peer"

3. **Default Fallback**: Verify OApps deployed after defaults correctly inherit them by checking:
   ```graphql
   query {
     oAppSecurityConfigs(where: { usesDefaultLibrary: true, usesDefaultConfig: true }) {
       oapp
       fallbackFields
     }
   }
   ```

## Warnings You May See

### "route explicitly blocked but packet delivered"
**Meaning**: An OApp explicitly set `peer` to zero address for a route (blocking it), but packets are still being delivered from that route. This could indicate:
- The OApp's peer configuration is out of sync with actual usage
- A security concern if the block was intentional
- The OApp unset the peer but continues to receive packets

**Example**: Your log showed receiver `0x03e5d4a0e3b3d239fcdc5a5fd84c1452204b14c4` received from `0xcc538c856cef0179d344d9fceedaf82bff3e098e` (srcEid 30102) but had explicitly configured peer as `0x0000...0000`.

### "sender does not match configured peer"
**Meaning**: The packet sender doesn't match the peer the OApp explicitly configured for that route. This could indicate:
- Configuration error
- The OApp changed its peer but the old peer is still sending
- Potential security issue

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Resync indexer from scratch
2. Monitor warnings during indexing
3. Investigate any OApps with "route explicitly blocked" warnings
4. Verify `libraryStatus` distribution makes sense for your ecosystem
